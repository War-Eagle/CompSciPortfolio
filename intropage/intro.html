            <pre>                Hello! Welcome to my website! This was created under the guidance of 
         our lovely teacher, Mr. Hesby. Throughout the class, we learned about computer science, 
         and along the way, we made some of our own things. What you are reading right now
         is a prime exampe of this. As you can see, there is a nav bar that I have created below.
         Dpending on what you click, it takes you there. But before you click on any of them, I 
         would like to say that both of the generators were written before I knew the basics of
         code. That being said, please forgive the sloppiness of them. Other than that, enjoy!
