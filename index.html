    <pre id="gitmean">                     Welcome to my website! If you are wondering why this is the first page, it's because Git Hub is mean... 
                Anyways, click anything from the nav bar to go there. If you can't find the nav bar, it's either because you are blind,
                or I somehow messed up the code. If you are blind, I am supprised that you've read this far... If you are wondering why
                I am just ranting about random things, it's because the tag pre looks pretty bad if you don't have a lot of text, so 
                here it is. Because this is just filler, I would like to say that while I was coding this whole website together, I was
                jamming out to Tenacious D. Just a side-note, listening to them while you are coding makes you go so much faster. 
                Well, that seems like enough filler, enjoy the rest of the website by the way. Bye!
