        <pre>                  Welcome to the about me page! If you want to learn some interesting things
           about me, read on! If not... okay.. move on. Anyways, my name is Mark, and I am the only freshman 
           in this class! So that's cool. I was interested in this class because my dad and sister both
           are coders. I also like video games, they're pretty cool. Some things that I am super pround of
           are probably anything that I made after the two generators. They are pretty bad.. But other than
           that, I am super proud of everything else. The thing that I am most pround about is my Vindinium
           bot. It was at the start of these past two weeks that I really started to get okay at coding, 
           and the Vindinium bot that I made was pretty good.
